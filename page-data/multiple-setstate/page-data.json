At the end of the batch the state will be 6. If you call <code class=\"language-text\">setCount(c =&gt; c + 1)</code> three times, your state will increased by 1 three times. At the end of the batch, the state will be 8.\nThe general rule is that if your new state relies on the current state, always use an updater function, even if you don't plan to call multiple setState functions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Multiple setstate","date":"sep 12, 2020","tags":["hooks","react"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/multiple-setstate/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
