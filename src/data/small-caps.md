Small caps (капитель) variant of the font (lowercase characters typeset with glyphs that resemble uppercase letters ("capitals") but reduced in height and weight, close to the surrounding lowercase (small) letters or text figures)

```css
p {
  font-variant: small-caps;
}
```

Flexbox sizes will be ignored if there is not enough space and content will shrink. Add `flex-shrink: 0` to override
